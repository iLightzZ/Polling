# Polling
Date: 1/13/2021<br>

## Description
The Internet and the web are enabling more people to network, join a cause, voice opinions, and so on. Recent presidential candidates have used the Internet intensively to get out their messages and raise money for their campaigns. In this exercise, youâ€™ll write a simple polling program that allows users to rate five social-consciousness issues from 1 (least important) to 10 (most important). Pick five causes that are important to you (e.g., political issues, global environmental issues).<br> 
Have your friends and family respond to the survey. 
Then the program displays a summary of the results, including:
- a) A tabular report with the five topics down the left side and the 10 ratings across the top,
listing in each column the number of ratings received for each topic.
- b) To the right of each row, show the average of the ratings for that issue.
- c) Which issue received the highest point total? (Display both the issue and the point total)
- d) Which issue received the lowest point total? (Display both the issue and the point total)

## Project Aim
A simple polling program that allows users to rate five social-consciousness issues from 1 (least important) to 10 (most important).
